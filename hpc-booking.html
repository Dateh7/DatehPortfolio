  <!-- PROJECT STORY -->
  <div class="detail-section">
    <h2> Project Story</h2>
    <p>
      The idea for the <strong>HPC Facility Booking System</strong> was born inside the High Performance Centre itself.
      During a training session with my biokineticist, I noticed how the team managed all facility reservations through
      a handwritten booking book — pages filled with names, times, and notes. I immediately saw the potential to digitize
      this process and knew I had both the technical background and understanding of their daily workflow to make it happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      What began as a concept quickly evolved into a fully operational web application. Today, the HPC Booking System
      is actively used by administrators, physios, and bios to manage bookings, coordinate schedules, and ensure smooth
      facility utilization — all from one centralized digital platform.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <div class="detail-section">
    <h2> Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The system provides a streamlined, role-based environment where different user groups — including Admins, Physios,
      Bios, and Super Admins — can efficiently manage facility schedules, recurring bookings, and operational oversight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its primary purpose is to improve coordination, eliminate double-booking, and build accountability within HPC’s
      day-to-day operations. Designed for clarity, performance, and maintainability, it runs as a stable production system
      supporting real-world university use.
